# Note about ioc file

Currently CubeMX templates are not implemented for the 3rd party
I-CUBE-USBD-Composite package

See [Issue](https://github.com/alambe94/I-CUBE-USBD-Composite/issues/2)

To fix this I've disabled the package in the CubeMX IOC file to prevent it being
regenerated and have simply renamed and included the populated files.
